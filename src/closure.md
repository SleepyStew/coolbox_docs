**👋 A Farewell from CoolBox: Announcing Our Closure**
------------------------------------------------------

To the wonderful students who have used and supported CoolBox over the years,

We are writing to share the bittersweet news that **CoolBox will be officially closing its service and retiring the browser extension and related systems on December 10th, 2025**.

As many of you know, CoolBox was developed and maintained by us, **Michael Curtis** and **Nathan Little**, to make the schoolbox experience better for the students of DCC. I fondly remember sitting with Nathan in Year 9 Research Science conjuring up a system that would make school easier. Instead of actually doing the assignment in front of me, I convinced myself that building a system to "optimize" my workflow was a better use of time… It was the ultimate disguised procrastination technique: spending hours coding a tool just to avoid doing the actual schoolwork. After several years of supporting the extension, and with us both completing our time at the school, we have made the difficult decision to cease operations.

We explored every possibility for CoolBox to continue in many constructive discussions with the school's IT department, but unfortunately without dedicated personnel to maintain the extension and ensure its continuous compatibility with future school system updates, we cannot confidently guarantee its future stability or security.

### **What This Means for You**

*   **Service End Date:** The CoolBox extension will stop receiving updates and its backend services will cease functioning on **December 10th, 2025**.

*   **Data:** As per our Privacy Policy, we maintained minimal data. If you wish to request the specific deletion of any data associated with your account, please contact **Michael Curtis** via Teams or Discord within the next 30 days.


### **Thank You**

We are incredibly proud of what CoolBox and its community has achieved – from organizing subject work, to automating room change notifications, to creating a fully customisable modular homepage – we are grateful for the support, feature ideas, and positive feedback we received from all of you.

### **The Future of CoolBox**

While we cannot continue maintenance, the project remains available for any **future students / aspiring developers** who are interested in reviving the project. We would be happy to discuss the onboarding of the project with anyone who is serious about taking it on and continuing its legacy with the school's support.

Thank you again for using CoolBox. We hope it made your school life a little bit easier!

Sincerely,

Michael and Nathan<br>
