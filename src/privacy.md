### **1. Introduction**

CoolBox is a browser extension designed to enhance your SchoolBox experience. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any information we collect during your use of CoolBox. This Privacy Policy outlines our data collection practices, how we use that information, and the measures we take to safeguard your privacy.

### **2. Information We Collect**

In order to provide and improve CoolBox's functionality, we collect the following information:

* **Schoolbox Token:** During an API request, CoolBox collects your Schoolbox token. This token is immediately hashed on our secure servers and is used solely for the purpose of user verification. Your original Schoolbox token is not stored.
* **Full Name and Year Level:** To personalize your experience and ensure the relevance of features, CoolBox collects your full name and year level. This information allows us to tailor functionalities to your specific needs.
* **Subjects:** To enable the automated room change display feature, CoolBox collects a list of your enrolled subjects. This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it is not linked to any individual user.
* **Anonymous Usage Statistics:** CoolBox collects anonymous usage statistics to help us identify areas for improvement. This data does not include any personally identifiable information and is used solely for analytical purposes.

### **3. How We Use Your Information**

The information we collect is used for the following purposes:

* **User Verification:** The hashed Schoolbox token is used to verify your identity when you make requests to our backend, ensuring that only authorized users can access CoolBox's features.
* **Personalization:** Your full name and year level enable us to personalize your experience within CoolBox, providing relevant information and tailoring functionalities to your specific needs.
* **Room Change Automation:** The anonymized collection of subject data allows CoolBox to automate room changes, reducing the time spent checking notifications.
* **Service Improvement:** Anonymous usage statistics are analyzed to gain insights into user behavior and preferences. This analysis helps us improve CoolBox's performance, usability, and feature set.

### **4. Data Security**

We prioritize the security of your information and employ robust security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include:

* **Hashing:** Your Schoolbox token is immediately hashed upon collection, rendering it unreadable and protecting your login credentials.
* **Encryption:** All collected data is stored in a secure SQL database that is encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods provided by Django, a secure web framework.
* **Secure Storage:** Our servers are maintained in a secure environment with restricted access to prevent unauthorized data breaches.
* **No Third-Party Sharing:** We do not share any of your personal data with any third-party APIs or services, ensuring that your information remains confidential.

### **5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies**

CoolBox does not use cookies - other than collecting the SchoolBox Token - or any other tracking technologies to monitor your online activity or collect information about your browsing behavior outside of the extension's functionality.

### **6. Third-Party APIs**

CoolBox utilizes the following third-party APIs to enhance its functionality:

* **Weather API:** To provide up-to-date weather information.
* **Bible Gateway API:** To provide the daily Bible verse.
* **Profanity API:** To filter inappropriate language in user feedback and maintain a respectful user environment.
* **Discord API:** To link users who choose to join the CoolBox Discord server for community support and interaction.

No personal data is shared with these APIs.

### **8. Data Deletion**

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data collected by CoolBox. To request data deletion, please contact the developers through the CoolBox Discord server or in person.

### **9. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices or legal obligations. Any changes to this policy will be announced in the CoolBox Discord server. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
